# Ecom
A sample Ecom application is built using Spring Boot and provides a robust RESTful API for managing the e-commerce platform. It handles all server-side operations, including product management, database interactions, and file uploads.

Features
RESTful APIs: Endpoints for managing products (CRUD operations).
Database Integration: Uses PostgreSQL for data persistence.
File Uploads: Supports image uploads for products.
Search Functionality: Search products by name, brand, description, or category.
Layered Architecture: Follows a clean separation of concerns with Controller, Service, and Repository layers.
Error Handling: Custom exception handling for better API responses.

Tech Stack
Framework: Spring Boot
Database: PostgreSQL
ORM: JPA (Java Persistence API)
Build Tool: Maven
Utilities: Lombok for reducing boilerplate code

Folder Structure
Controller: Handles incoming HTTP requests and maps them to services.
Example: ProductController.java
Service: Contains business logic for the application.
Example: ProductService.java
Repository: Interfaces for database operations using JPA.
Example: ProductRepo.java
Model: Entity classes representing database tables.
Example: Product.java
Exception: Custom exceptions and global exception handlers.
